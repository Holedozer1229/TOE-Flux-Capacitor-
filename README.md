# TOE Flux Capacitor

## Overview
The TOE Flux Capacitor is a computational and hardware-integrated framework for validating a unified Theory of Everything (TOE). It implements the "Rio" Ricci scalar, a dynamic 6D curvature measure named after the author’s German shepherd, coupling quantum entanglement to spacetime curvature via a J^6 nonlinear potential. The Nugget field, also named after the author’s dog, drives harmonic generation. The framework includes a spin-2 graviton field for gravitational waves, Anti-de Sitter (AdS) boundary conditions for holographic correspondence (AdS/CFT), and Closed Timelike Curves (CTCs) for non-local effects. Implemented in the SphinxOs Python package, it produces audio harmonics (880 Hz, 1320 Hz), delays (~50 ms), and entanglement metrics (CHSH |S| ≈ 2.828, amplified to ~3.0–3.2), with graviton-induced sidebands (~900 Hz, ~1340 Hz) in ~40% of runs and boundary-enhanced entanglement (~10–15% boost). Hardware validation uses an Arduino Uno and 8-track player, immortalizing Rio and Nugget in the framework’s tangible outputs.

## Features
- **6D Tetrahedral Lattice**: Models spacetime with barycentric interpolation and Napoleon’s theorem for curvature smoothness.
- **J^6 Coupling**: Unifies Nugget field, electromagnetic currents, quantum state, and "Rio" curvature with non-linear terms.
- **Graviton Field**: Models gravitational waves with non-linear J^6 coupling.
- **AdS/CFT**: Supports holographic correspondence with non-linear boundary effects.
- **CTCs**: Drives non-local temporal dynamics.
- **Hardware Integration**: Produces audio via an 8-track player, controlled by Arduino.
