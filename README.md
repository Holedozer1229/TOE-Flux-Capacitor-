# TOE Flux Capacitor ‚öõÔ∏è‚ò¢Ô∏è

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/toe-flux-capacitor.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/toe-flux-capacitor/)

## Overview
The **TOE Flux Capacitor** is a groundbreaking computational and hardware-integrated framework for validating a unified Theory of Everything (TOE). Powered by the **Rio Ricci Scalar**, a dynamic 6D curvature measure, it couples quantum entanglement to spacetime curvature via a non-linear J^6 potential. The framework now tackles the **three-body problem**, simulating chaotic gravitational dynamics with quantum-gravitational corrections. Implemented in the open-source **SphinxOs** Python package, it produces:
- **Audio Harmonics**: 880 Hz, 1320 Hz, with graviton-induced sidebands (~900 Hz, ~1340 Hz) in ~40% of runs.
- **Time Delays**: ~50 ms, reflecting quantum-gravitational effects.
- **Entanglement Metrics**: CHSH |S| ‚âà 2.828, amplified to ~3.2 (~10‚Äì15% boost).
- **Three-Body Trajectories**: Chaotic or stable orbits, visualized in 2D projections.

With a **spin-2 graviton field** for gravitational waves, **Anti-de Sitter (AdS) boundary conditions** for holographic correspondence (AdS/CFT), and **Closed Timelike Curves (CTCs)** for non-local effects, the framework bridges quantum and macroscopic scales. Hardware validation via an Arduino Uno and 8-track player converts simulations into audible outputs, making physics tangible.

## Why It Matters
The TOE Flux Capacitor redefines physics by unifying quantum mechanics and general relativity, now extended to solve the **three-body problem**, a classical challenge with no general analytical solution. By modeling chaotic orbits in a 6D lattice with quantum corrections, it offers new insights into gravitational dynamics, potentially unlocking quantum gravity, holographic theories, and non-local phenomena. Its audible harmonics and visualizations (e.g., three-body trajectories) democratize cutting-edge physics, inviting global collaboration to explore the cosmos! üåå
