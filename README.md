# TOE Flux Capacitor ‚öõÔ∏è‚ò¢Ô∏è

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/toe-flux-capacitor.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/toe-flux-capacitor/)

## Overview
The **TOE Flux Capacitor** is a revolutionary computational and hardware-integrated framework for a unified **Theory of Everything (TOE)**. Powered by the **Rio Ricci Scalar**, a dynamic 6D curvature measure, it couples **quantum entanglement** to **spacetime curvature** via a **non-linear J^6 potential**, now tackling the **three-body problem** with quantum-gravitational corrections. Implemented in the open-source **SphinxOs** Python package, it produces:
- **Three-Body Trajectories**: Chaotic or stable orbits, visualized in 2D (`results/trajectories_*.png`).
- **Audio Harmonics**: 880 Hz, 1320 Hz, with graviton-induced sidebands (~900 Hz, ~1340 Hz) in ~40% of runs.
- **Time Delays**: ~50 ms, reflecting quantum-gravitational and CTC effects.
- **Entanglement Metrics**: CHSH |S| ‚âà 2.828, amplified to ~3.2 (~10‚Äì15% boost).
- **Zero-Point Energy (ZPE)**: Simulated extraction from quantum vacuum fluctuations, enhancing quantum computing applications.

With a **6D tetrahedral lattice**, **spin-2 graviton field**, **Anti-de Sitter (AdS) boundary conditions** for holographic correspondence (AdS/CFT), and **Closed Timelike Curves (CTCs)** for non-local dynamics, the framework bridges quantum and macroscopic scales. New quantum computing extensions, including a **holographic PennyLane CTC J^6 model** and **ZPE extraction**, position it as a leader in quantum gravity and quantum machine learning. Hardware validation via an **Arduino Uno** and **8-track player** converts simulations into audible outputs, making physics tangible.

## Why It Matters
The TOE Flux Capacitor redefines physics by unifying **quantum mechanics** and **general relativity**, solving the **three-body problem**‚Äîa classical challenge with no general analytical solution‚Äîthrough quantum corrections in a 6D lattice. Its **ZPE extraction** model explores quantum vacuum energy, potentially unlocking new energy paradigms. By offering quantum computing applications like **quantum simulation**, **holographic error correction**, **non-local algorithms**, **quantum machine learning**, and **quantum sensing**, it paves the way for breakthroughs in quantum gravity, astrophysics, and technology. Its audible harmonics, visualizations, and open-source accessibility democratize cutting-edge physics, inviting global collaboration to explore the cosmos! üåå
